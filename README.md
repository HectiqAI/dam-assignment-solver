## Introduction

DAM offers a tutoring program to high school students. They needed a tool to automatically assign volunteers (tutors) to students. 

A student and a tutor can only be matched if:

-	They share at least 1 hour availability
-	The student's school is part of the preferred tutor's schools.
-	A student can only be paired with at most one tutor.
-	A tutor can only be paired with at most one student.

And we maximize:

- Pair the most number of students.
- Assign most tutors to their preferred schools.
- Pair the students most needed subjects with the tutors preferred subjects.
